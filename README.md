# Fake-TeamViewer-Update
READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE AND FOLLOW THEM

This is to be used on scammers at your own risk. I will not be responsible for any damage that you may have cause to your computer by misusing this.

To use this, you must know the admin password on the scammer's pc and the scammer must already have Teamviewer installed.

I wanted to use WannaCry for this but I read some articles about it and it seems that WannaCry doesn't work anymore. I may be wrong about that but it's fine.

I would also like to make an .exe file that does this same thing but instead of requiring the admin password, it has one of those admin popups that you see when running something as administrator but I don't know how to make executable files. If anyone has any information on how to do that, it would be much appreciated.
